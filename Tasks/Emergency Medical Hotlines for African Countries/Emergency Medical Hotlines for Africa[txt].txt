Compiling all medical emergency hotlines in every government and private hospital across all states and local government areas (LGAs) in Nigeria is a massive and complex task, as:
There is no centralized national directory of emergency numbers per hospital or LGA.
Many government hospitals, especially in rural areas, do not operate dedicated emergency hotlines.
Private hospitals vary widely in whether they publish or operate 24/7 emergency numbers.
Emergency response services like ambulances are not consistently available across all LGAs.
