Methodology
The team conducted targeted searches using the disease as the primary focus, limiting results to verifiable websites containing relevant clinical information (symptoms, description, prognosis)..
Priority was given to meta-analyses, systematic reviews, clinical guidelines, and high-quality original research.
Articles were screened for relevance by reviewing titles and abstracts, followed by full-text analysis for data extraction.
We systematically cross-verified sources to:
Elevate the most efficient and current information
Replace low-reliability or obsolete content
Hybridize partial data by merging complementary factors from multiple sources.
The team filtered results to include only English-language articles published primarily from 2018â€“2025, prioritizing current data.
Human studies only
Challenges Faced
Limited data were available for some rare diseases or newly characterized conditions, leading to reliance on smaller case series or expert opinion.
Some epidemiological data were region-specific, limiting generalizability.
Variability in diagnostic criteria and nomenclature across studies occasionally complicated direct comparisons.
Access to full-text articles was occasionally restricted, requiring use of abstracts or secondary sources.

Priority was given to meta-analyses, systematic reviews, clinical guidelines, and high-quality original research.
Articles were screened for relevance by reviewing titles and abstracts, followed by full-text analysis for data extraction.
